## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm currently working toward my Masterâ€™s in Data Analytics at Northeastern University, where Iâ€™ve been building skills in SQL, Python, R, Excel, and Tableau. I'm passionate about building scalable software solutions and leveraging my analytical
background to create intelligent systems. Also, I've enjoyed working on projects that involve creating dashboards, running predictive models, and using data to better support business decisions. I'm now looking for a Software Engineer/ Data Analyst full-time role where I can keep learning and contribute to real-world scenarios through data and storytelling.
